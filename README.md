# SegmentedRESTREND

This script is a a demsonstration of the Segmented RESTREND method proposed in Burrell et. al., (2016). 

_Note. This is not the script used to produce the results in Burrell et. al., (2016). The code for that paper used both python and R, was designed specifically for the data sets used (can't be used with any dataset), and it was focused on parallelised computing. This code is much simplified and has not been speedtested._
