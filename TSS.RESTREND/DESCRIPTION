Description:Time Series Segmented Residual Trends is a method for the automated detection
    of land degradation from remotely sensed vegetation and climate datasets.
    TSS-RESTREND incorporates aspects of two existing degradation detection methods:
    RESTREND which is used to control for climate variability, and BFAST which
    is used to look for structural changes in the ecosystem. The full details
    of the testing and justification of the TSS-RESTREND method (version 0.1.02)
    are published in Burrell et al., (2017). 
    The changes to the method introduced in version 0.2.03 focus on the inclusion 
    of temperature as an additional climate variable. This allows for land 
    degradation assessment in temperature limited drylands. A paper that details
    this work is currently under review. There are also a number of bug fixes
    and speed improvements. The version under active development and additional  
    example scripts can be can be found at \url{https://
    github.com/ArdenB/TSSRESTREND}.
