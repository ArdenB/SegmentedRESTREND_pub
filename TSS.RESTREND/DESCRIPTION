Description: 
    This branch is a development branch where i'm attempint to include multiple
    Climate variable, (Temperature and precipitation).
    TSS.RESTREND This script is a a demonstration of the Segmented
    RESTREND method proposed in Burrell et. al., (2017).  TSS.RESTREND is a
    modification of the RESTREND method originally proposed by
    Evans and Geerken (2006). It incoperates BFAST breakpoint detection to
    look for major ecosystem changes. The version in development and additional
    documentation, data and example scripts can be can be found at \url{https://
    github.com/ArdenB/TSSRESTREND}.
