\usage{
VPR.BFAST(CTSR.VI, CTSR.RF, print = FALSE, plot = TRUE, details = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{CTSR.VI}{Complete Time Series of Vegetation Index. An object of class \code{'ts'}. Monthly time series of VI values}

\item{CTSR.RF}{Complete Time Series of Rain Fall.  An object of class 'ts' and be the same length and cover the same time range as CTSR.VI.
If ACU.table is provided, CTSR.RF will be automitaclly calculated by \code{\link{rainfall.accumulator}}}

\item{print}{Prints more details at every step of the procces}

\item{plot}{creates a plots of every step}

\item{details}{returns adational details for BFAST}

\item{sig}{Significance of all the functions, sig=0.05}
}

\description{
This function will perform the complete Time Series Segmented Residual Trend (TSS.RESTREND) methodology.Takes in a complete monthly time series of a VI and its corrosponding precipitation. Will caculate missing input varibles,
look for breakpoints using the BFAST function. The significance of the breakpoin in the residuals and the VPR is assessed using a chow test an
then the total time series change is calculated. Calls ____________
